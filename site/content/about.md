## Our catering company

Santa began cooking with her Mom, baking her first pumpkin pie at the age of five. A natural in the kitchen, she could always be found helping to prepare the famous multi-course dinners for her large Italian family gatherings, including her favorite Christmas Eve meal, Festa Dei Sette Pesci, Feast of the Seven Fishes.

A native New Yorker, she went on to have a successful career in the title industry but never stopped cooking. Her love of food and entertaining continued, inspiring her countless impromptu dinner parties to the delight of her many friends and neighbors. On any given night the menu might consist of the latest creations she’s testing out or tried and true favorites she’s lovingly prepared, always preceded by one of her delicious signature Santa salads.

Be it an elegant five course meal specially prepared in your home or ready to eat specialties delivered directly to your door, Santa will happily provide wholesome delectable meals prepared especially for you made with highest quality ingredients locally sourced from Union Square’s Green Market and various other specialty markets.
